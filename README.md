# Insufficient Error Handling in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that lacks proper error handling for database operations and invalid user IDs. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug Description
The original code lacks comprehensive error handling for database interactions and situations where a user ID is invalid.  It uses inconsistent and inappropriate HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

## Solution
The improved code includes comprehensive error handling using try-catch blocks and explicit checks for null/undefined values, using proper HTTP status codes to communicate errors to the client more effectively, and better handling of database errors.  Error messages are more informative, improving the debugging experience and client experience.
